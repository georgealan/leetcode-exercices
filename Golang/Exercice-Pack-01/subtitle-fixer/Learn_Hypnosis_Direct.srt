00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,740


61
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,020
hypnotizing them you just tell them to

62
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,020

not a suggestion right so you're going

66
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,159


67
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,360
to hypnotize the person first and then

68
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,360


69
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,400
you're going to give your suggestions

70
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,400


71
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,960
and your direction now how do you

72
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,960


73
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,580
structure these suggestions though this

74
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,580


75
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,020
is system into this all right so let's

76
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,020


77
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,840
talk about the first thing is we want

78
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,840


79
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,220
them to be stated in the positive right

80
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,220


81
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,140
which means you're always going to tell

82
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,140


83
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,240
them what will happen or what they are

84
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,240


85
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,920
going to do instead of what they aren't

86
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,920


87
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,439
going to do right so if we were to talk

88
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,439


89
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,299
about let's say smoking cessation you're

90
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,299


91
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,220
not going to Crave cigarettes anymore

92
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,220


93
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,780
what other stupidness you won't wake up

94
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,780


95
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,579
in the morning and think of smoking as

96
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,579


97
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,900
soon as you you know have breakfast or

98
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,900


99
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,520
you're not going to tell them what won't

100
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,520


101
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,140
happen tell them what will happen you're

102
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,140


103
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
not going to waste all that money yeah

104
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,360


105
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,979
you're gonna keep it positive the next

106
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,979


107
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,079
point is we want to keep them short

108
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,079


109
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,299
right sure we do the best suggestions

110
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,299


111
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,100
are 10 words or less keep them short

112
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,100


113
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,380
tight so they go right into the

114
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,380


115
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,720
unconscious mind and we want them to be

116
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,720


117
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,180
simple right so a suggestion that is

118
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,180


119
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,459
short often will be simple but I guess

120
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,459


121
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,440
we can combine those short and simple

122
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,440


123
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,940
and positives this isn't the time to say

124
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,940

130
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,980


131
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,260
you want to repeat them in different

132
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,260


133
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,120
