1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,440
A real nail-biter here at Mile High Stadium.

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,240
The broncos down by one, and 30 
seconds left on the clock.

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,770
Come on, Broncos, you can do it.

4
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,430
And I'm joined in the broadcast booth

5
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,160
by the stars of ABC's latest reality 
show, billionaire versus bear.

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,580
Let's review the easy-to-follow 
rules of your show.

7
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,320
Each of you thought you were in a race

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,310
to plant the taco bell flag at the north pole.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,990
What you didn't know is, the race was a chase,

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,070
spiced up by the presence of the betrayer.

11
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,720
Well, now, the bear has a surprise for you.

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,480
He's not really a bear, he's a tiger!

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,620
Ho! Lookie there!

14
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,030
Denver just won the ballgame!

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh, the Broncos won?

16
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,950
Why didn't I bet on them like 
professor pigskin told me to?

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,510
Who's professor pigskin?

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,100
He's a pig who can predict 
football winners in advance!

19
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,020
How is that possible?

20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,120
Because he's got something no gambler's ever had:

21
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,280
A system!

22
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,400
I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row,

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
and every time, the pick-of-the-week 
has been right on the money.

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,490
Ah... I get it.

25
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,110
Every week, they send out two 
pamphlets, half picking

26
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,710
one team and half picking the other.

27
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,620
Eventually, there's a small group of people

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,490
who only receive the correct predictions

29
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,770
and think professor pigskin is always right.

30
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,100
That's when they ask for your money.

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,650
I have money!

32
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,460
Dad, it's a scam!

33
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,390
A scam?! Not according to Eddie F. From Tucson,

34
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,230
or football millionaire in Beloit, Michigan.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,160
Look, all I'm saying is, you really 
should think twice before...

36
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,540
Expiration date: 06/08.

37
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,030
Oh, professor pigskin told me

38
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,110
to bet on the Raiders, but they look awful!

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,180
And with 37 starting players

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,940
out with the flu, the Oakland Raiders

41
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,900
have turned to drunks conscripted from local bars.

42
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,100
Spare some change, football dude?

43
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,200
Now, you have a good day.

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,560
Dad, how much money did you bet?

45
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,800
Hey, I didn't bet any of our money.

46
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,770
I just borrowed some from him.

47
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,810
Don't worry, we can hammer out a payment plan.

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,700
It's not my fault the Raiders lost!

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,350
It's professor pigskin's!

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,860
If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.

51
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,740
But the pig...

52
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,670
Now, i do have a way we could settle this debt.

53
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,930
We would like to use your home 
to shoot an adult film.

54
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,790
Yeah, it's called lemony lick-it:

55
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,980
A series of horny events.

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,840
Marge would kill me!

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,600
Please! There's got to be something else I can do.

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,970
Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks.

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,530
I can't do it next week.

60
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,470
All right!

61
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,000
You can shoot your gay adult film at my house.

62
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,030
I didn't say anything about gay.

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,970
I thought you guys were the gay mafia.

64
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,400
They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow.

65
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,670
How am I gonna get rid of marge and the kids?

66
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,180
Well, I got these free tickets to santa's village.

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,420
I know a guy who turns the dead

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,510
sleigh horses into jerky and sells it to bars.

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,940
Thanks, Moe!

70
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,210
Why would we want to go to santa's village?

71
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,240
It's august.

72
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,450
I want to see santa--

73
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,810
he can explain why he gave 
me a playstation box

74
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,590
with nothing inside but a coloring book.

75
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,160
It got your hopes up, didn't it?

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,460
Homer, before I take the kids,

77
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,980
I want you to swear you're not up to something.

78
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,160
I swear.

79
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,070
And I'd also like to know why 
your hand is in that cast.

80
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,750
Because you look even more beautiful 
now than the day I married you.

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,600
Welcome to santa's village, 
where it's christmas every day.

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,780
Closed on christmas.

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,370
Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,070
That's because they don't 
thrive in this environment!

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,290
Watcha reading, Santa?

86
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,160
Tom clancy's op-center.

87
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,470
You don't seem very jolly.

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,070
Well, santa got some bad medical news.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,660
And... action!

90
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,140
We've been on this spaceship for a hundred years.

91
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,440
When will we ever get to planet satisfaction?

92
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,370
Hey, Homer, we..

93
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,260
Angela Dare!

94
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,060
Sultry Stevens !

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,360
Yeah, what is this, a reunion 
of Fahrenheit 9 on 1?

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,830
Guys! Get out of here!

97
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,530
Homer, how'd you ever get Marge

98
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,480
to go along with this?

99
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,630
Look, if you promise never to tell her,

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,820
I'll let you be in the movie.

101
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,390
We just came over to borrow 
a board game, but okay.

102
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,900
I've always dreamed of 
working in an adult film.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,110
I'll run the sound board!

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,010
And I'll perform in the sex scenes!

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
Merry christmas!

106
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,020
I'm your old pal frosty the snowman!

107
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,260
In your dreams.

108
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,860
Frosty!

109
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,580
Where's your magic top hat?

110
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,220
Oh, god, please don't tell mr. Roselli

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,780
I lost my hat again!

112
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,070
My christmas present to myself this year

113
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,860
was leaving that place early.

114
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,870
Mom...

115
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,750
I got a rash where the reindeer licked me.

116
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,510
When they put santa in the ambulance,

117
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,860
why'd they pull the blanket all 
the way up over his head?

118
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,530
Now, look, I know this wasn't 
the greatest outing,

119
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,990
but your father meant well, so 
don't let him know that we didn't...

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,150
Are you guys almost done?

121
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,050
Listen, I got a tattoo of foghorn 
leghorn on my right thigh.

122
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,620
Are we gonna get into any trademark 
or copyright issues here?

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,300
'Cause we could put a band-aid on it

124
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,150
and say my character just got stabbed.

125
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Relax, three guys'll put their hands on it, okay?

126
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,980
Now, everybody is very much in love.

127
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,550
And... action!

128
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,290
Homer! Is this a snuggle film?

129
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,900
You're in the wrong house, lady!

130
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,660
How could you allow this, 
in the room where we do puzzles!

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,260
Honey, please, just listen 
to what I have to say.

132
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,250
All right.

133
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,980
I owed the mafia money.

134
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,220
Where are you going?

135
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,180
Away from you.

136
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,110
When will you be back?

137
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,780
I don't know.

138
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,850
Who's going to watch the kids?

139
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,580
You are.

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,830
Me? But I'm the father!

141
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,140
Boy, Homer, I've never 
see mom this mad.

142
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,410
Honey, come back!

143
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,600
You didn't say bye to the kids!

144
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,350
Bye, Bart.

145
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,650
I love you, Lisa.

146
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,890
Sleep tight, Maggie.

147
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,680
Today's the last day you can 
eat the yogurt in the fridge.

148
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,180
Well, we better go eat that yogurt.

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,110
It's dinnertime.

150
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,030
Look, we've been down this road before.

151
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,460
I do something stupid you mom 
leaves, we eat waffles.

152
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,670
We're out of waffles.

153
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,690
All we got is ketchup.

154
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,040
You mean Homer's famous marinara sauce?

155
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,230
No, I mean ketchup.

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,140
Where's your sense of magic and wonder?!

157
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on, Marge.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When are you going to call?

159
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,410
Let it ring, play hard to get.

160
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,230
That's hard enough!

161
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,620
Oh, my darling, I love you!

162
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,290
Please forgive me!

163
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,930
Hey, Homer.

164
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,640
Moe, what are you calling me for?

165
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,260
You told me to call. You wanted 
to see if your phone was working.

166
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,140
But what if marge tries to 
call while I'm talking to you?

167
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,310
Ain't you got call waiting?

168
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,820
Of course, I have call waiting, you idiot!

169
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,630
I just never learned how to use it!

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,890
I might have broken the phone.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,960
I better call Moe.

172
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,090
Hey, Homer.

173
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,010
Moe, will you get off the line?!

174
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,610
I guess I better tell them I'm coming home.

175
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,160
Marge, what a pleasant surprise.

176
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,540
I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield.

177
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,280
I know. You're sorry now.

178
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,620
Then you'll buy me some Quickie Mart Flowers,

179
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,970
maybe a box of candy, where half the pieces

180
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,790
mysteriously have testing bites,

181
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,030
and a week later you'll be back 
to your old thoughtless self.

182
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,890
No, no, it's not going to 
be like that, I swear.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
Lemon cream.

184
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,300
You're going in the Marge pile.

185
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,900
I mean, I love you so much.

186
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,040
Yeah, I love you, too.

187
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,010
Hold on.

188
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,050
I'll be off in a minute.

189
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,460
Listen, buster, I had to buy 
a club soda I didn't want

190
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,030
to get change for this phone.

191
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,050
An oogly-boogly!

192
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,120
Be still.

193
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,710
Don't give it the phone.

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,910
Settle down, sugar plum.

195
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,960
Look what daddy's got in his pocket.

196
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,740
Yummy, yummy kelp.

197
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,950
Good girl, yes, yes.

198
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,110
This animal means you no harm.

199
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,460
She's a sweet old Florida manatee,

200
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,890
also known as a sea cow or dugong.

201
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,380
Hello, Marge, where do we keep the 
socks that don't smell like feet?

202
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,100
I'll call you back.

203
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,130
I'm Dr. Caleb Thorn, and I would do anything

204
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,370
to protect a manatee except 
harm another manatee.

205
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,180
What if by harming a manatee 
you could save two manatees?

206
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,580
But before you answer, consider this:

207
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,660
The manatee you have to harm is pregnant.

208
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,970
Those are the questions that 
keep me up at night.

209
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,434
I see a manatee the needs a hug.

210
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,247
Hello, Marge?

211
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,011
Does the pizza guy take a check?

212
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,843
If so, where do we keep the checks?

213
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,886
And lastly, how do you write a check?

214
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:12,605
I think the worst part was when I realized

215
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,044
that homer lied to me.

216
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,525
From what you've told me,

217
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:17,697
it sounds like what your husband did

218
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,597
is nothing new.

219
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,123
Exactly.

220
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,961
I have a saying which goes,

221
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,643
"you can't teach a manatee any tricks."

222
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,122
Maybe you could just put a hat 
on him and say it's a trick.

223
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,810
My point is Homer is the exact 
same man you married,

224
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,373
and if there's a problem here, it's that 
you keep expecting him to change.

225
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,583
He cares so much about those doggone dugongs.

226
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,810
I wish I felt that kind of passion.

227
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,833
Maybe I should join him on his mission.

228
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,767
Hey, lady blue, while you're sitting there

229
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,974
staring at the ceiling, you boyfriend's

230
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,108
in the parking lot with his hands in a walrus.

231
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,247
Yeah, that'll be good for business.

232
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,400
Got to find your mom.

233
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,363
Got to find your mom.

234
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,202
Dad, I promise

235
00:11:59,226 --> 00:11:59,991
I'll be good.

236
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,463
Can I get out of the dog carrier?

237
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,738
It was hard enough getting you in there.

238
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,737
I'm not letting you out.

239
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:05,747
Yeah, she came through here.

240
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:10,142
I believe she was looking to 
rekindle her passion for life.

241
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,159
Ain't that right, victor?

242
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:11,671
Oh, yes.

243
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,989
Senora left for the coast

244
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,017
with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.

245
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,460
Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?

246
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh, no, no.

247
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,225
"Handsome" means he look at himself

248
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:23,037
in the mirror all day. "Rugged" 
means you look at him.

249
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,131
Okay, water monsters, be friendly...

250
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,452
but not too friendly.

251
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,113
What do I do?

252
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:41,073
Talk to it!

253
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:42,453
Let it know you're not a threat.

254
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:47,191
Oh, okay. You know, up close 
you're kinda cute.

255
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,032
You're a good thing.

256
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:51,846
I know it.

257
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,430
Let me clean out your ears.

258
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,163
I've bonded with him!

259
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,910
Where is he taking me?

260
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,562
To his underwater palace.

261
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,630
Just kidding.

262
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,218
It's a lagoon full of bugs.

263
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,194
Dad, I don't think we're 
going to find mom today.

264
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,357
And I'm sick of eating 
at restaurant chains

265
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,348
I've never even heard of like 
Skobo's and Dim Willie'S.

266
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,599
Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day.

267
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:32,041
I have cousins near here.

268
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,083
We'll stay with them.

269
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:33,987
Country cousins?

270
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,657
Are they rubes?

271
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:35,966
'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.

272
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,454
The rubiest.

273
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,735
Look, a new restaurant chain.

274
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,703
Can we say it's my birthday 
and get free stuff?

275
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,178
We'll say it's all our birthdays.

276
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,829
I cannot believe it.

277
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,487
Cousin Homer, how are you?

278
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,449
And this must be Bart and Lisa.

279
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,192
Well, aren't you nice-looking kids.

280
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:59,498
Hey, do you folks want to see a quilt

281
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,041
that's been in our family 
for five generations?

282
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,305
I warned you he was an idiot.

283
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:08,606
Well, all I need is some 
moonshine and someone playing

284
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:12,090
the harmonicky and I'm as 
happy as a pig in plop.

285
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,283
We're having lasagna and caesar salad.

286
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,076
Don't laugh.

287
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,340
They're doing the best they can.

288
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,722
So, Homer, how are you?

289
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:22,831
Oh, just great.

290
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:23,881
Things couldn't be better.

291
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,588
And how is our lovely Marge?

292
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:32,593
She, was killed by a 
falling air conditioner.

293
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,614
But that's terrible!

294
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,547
It wasn't all bad.

295
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,430
As part of the settlement, her 
funeral was air conditioned.

296
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,175
Now if you'll excuse me, I have 
to use the outhouse again.

297
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,545
Well, we don't have an outhouse.

298
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,493
My recording studio!

299
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:54,115
So how are we related again?

300
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,603
Our dogs are brothers.

301
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,134
Oh, yeah.

302
00:14:58,787 --> 00:14:59,938
I see mom!

303
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,459
I've got my groove back!

304
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,962
We've got to tell dad!

305
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:06,814
Where is he?

306
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,328
You lost that first game to hustle me!

307
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:22,274
I can't believe how many 
manatees we saved today.

308
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,630
And the ones we can't save, 
we put to good use.

309
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,778
what am I supposed to do, 
bury them at arlington?

310
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,661
Marge?

311
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:38,506
Homer?

312
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,959
These are for you.

313
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,273
Listen, I thought about what I did.

314
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:45,544
And it was really, really wrong.

315
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:47,493
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,573
Homie, I accept your apology.

317
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:52,755
I love you, Marge.

318
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:54,725
But I'm not coming back yet.

319
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,627
I've found a place where I'm needed.

320
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:58,987
You're needed at home!

321
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,916
And treated like I deserve.

322
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:03,709
You're needed at home!

323
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:04,932
I'm sorry, Homie.

324
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:08,119
I just can't find it in my 
heart to come back right now.

325
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,286
Well, that's very reasonable.

326
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,512
You stole my wife!

327
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,498
I'll kill you!

328
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:15,296
Homer, I have no interest 
in stealing your wife,

329
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,982
but Marge is getting something 
from her work with me.

330
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,711
Something a strong, passionate 
woman like her needs:

331
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:21,904
A purpose.

332
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,647
I can see why she loves you.

333
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:26,872
She doesn't love me.

334
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,450
She's just trying to find herself.

335
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,580
You know everything.

336
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,800
I don't know everything.

337
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm just a man.

338
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,744
And what a man!

339
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,315
Okay, the key to this thing 
is the manatees.

340
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,050
Is marge saving them or killing them?

341
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,778
Saving!

342
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:44,096
Okay. To save the manatees,

343
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,464
I guess I could donate 
my time and money

344
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:47,691
and help build them a...

345
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,181
Screw that.

346
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:50,532
Dad!

347
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,733
Those jet skiers are headed 
right for a herd of manatees!

348
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,559
Check out those gentle, 
exotic sea creatures.

349
00:16:58,596 --> 00:16:59,832
Let's whomp 'em!

350
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,307
Man, I just wish

351
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:08,619
we could see their tears.

352
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,035
why don't you pick on 
someone your own size?

353
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,651
They are roughly our size.

354
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,495
In fact, they're bigger than us.

355
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,673
Look, if it were up to me, 
I'd be harassing them with you.

356
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,868
If anything, I'd be the 
guy who took it too far.

357
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,370
But I love my wife and 
I want to win her back!

358
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,581
You're a brave man.

359
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:27,161
And we respect two things:

360
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:30,539
Bravery and tattoos that 
look like barbed wire.

361
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:31,320
Let's go.

362
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:36,557
Rubes!

363
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,285
What did you call us?

364
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,425
Catch me if you can!

365
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,910
Manatees-- defend!

366
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:13,947
Attention jet skiers.

367
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:18,623
I have a court order here requiring
you to vacate these waters.

368
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,238
No court order's gonna tell me what to do.

369
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:22,430
Oh, man--

370
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:23,531
it's notarized!

371
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:24,677
Let's boogie!

372
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,975
Homer, are you okay?

373
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,393
How many fingers am I holding up?

374
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:33,072
Poor dumb country mouse.

375
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:34,704
Can't even count.

376
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,256
My sweet,

377
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,156
sweet Homie!

378
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:42,363
You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.

379
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:44,772
Rubes...

380
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,776
so many rubeS...

381
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,861
pounding me with their jet skis...

382
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:50,286
rubes.

383
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,616
Please, no, rubes.

384
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,042
I'm gonna take you home and fix you up,

385
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,845
'cause you're the real endangered species--

386
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,893
a devoted husband.

387
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,775
Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.

388
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,400
And I always will.

389
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,636
I'm starting to think I should find a woman.

390
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,754
Yeah, miranda was nice, but I'm not driving

391
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,148
to corpus christi every time 
she needs a light bulb changed.

392
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:31,567
Amen.

393
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:34,803
Hey, since we got the kids 
with us, why don't we all take

394
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:37,294
a few days of much-needed r and r?

395
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,029
Don't you have to be back at work?

396
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:39,607
Yes.

397
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:42,655
But I've got a friend who 
owes me a solid.

398
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,945
Smithers, who is this barrel-chested go-getter?

399
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,191
I believe it's a manatee 
posing as homer simpson, sir.

400
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,989
Oh, that's cute.

401
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,228
I think this is the beginning 
of a beautiful friendship.

402
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,223
Actually, sir, I believe he's 
about to die of dehydration.

403
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,106
Good heavens!

404
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,860
Grab a sponge, man!

405
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:12,108
You might not ever get rich

406
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,394
but let me tell ya, it's

407
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:15,889
better than diggin' a ditch

408
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,279
there ain't no tellin'

409
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,833
who you might meet

410
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:23,104
a movie star or maybe

411
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,900
even an indian chief

412
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,827
workin' at the car wash...

413
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:30,681
...car wash
